## Development Scripts

- **`run_tests.py`** - Python script to run tests with coverage

## Internal Scripts

This directory also contains deployment and maintenance scripts that are used internally by project maintainers. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for maintainer-only documentation.

## Usage

### Running Tests with Coverage

From project root directory:
```bash
# Run specific tests with coverage report
python .\scripts\run_tests.py

# Run all tests (recommended for development)
python -m pytest
```

From scripts directory:
```bash
cd scripts
python run_tests.py
```
